Judge was unanimously selected as the American League (AL) Rookie of the Year in 2017, and finished second in voting for the AL Most Valuable Player Award that year.[1] In 2022, he set the AL record for most home runs in a season with 62, breaking the 61-year-old record held by Roger Maris, and winning the AL Most Valuable Player Award.[2] \n Judge played college baseball for the Fresno State Bulldogs, and the Yankees selected him with the 32nd pick in the first round of the 2013 MLB draft. After making his MLB debut in 2016 and hitting a home run in his first major league at bat, Judge went on to have a record-breaking rookie season. In 2017, he was named an All-Star, won the Home Run Derby (the first MLB rookie to do so), and hit 52 home runs, breaking Mark McGwire's MLB rookie record of 49 and Joe DiMaggio's Yankee full-season rookie record of 29. His rookie record stood for two years, until Pete Alonso hit 53 home runs in 2019. Judge won the AL Rookie of the Month Awards for April, May, June, and September, as well as the AL's Player of the Month Award for June and September. After the 2022 season, he re-signed with the Yankees on a nine-year, $360 million contract and was subsequently named the team's captain.\xa0 \n \n", 'tags': '', 'url': 'Star Player.html'}, {'title': 'Boston Red Sox', 'text': '', 'tags': '', 'url': 'Boston Red Sox.html'}, {'title': 'Baltimore Orioles', 'text': '', 'tags': '', 'url': 'Baltimore Orioles.html'}, {'title': 'Toronto Blue Jays', 'text': '', 'tags': '', 'url': 'Toronto Blue Jays.html'}, {'title': 'Tampa Bay Rays', 'text': '\n \n \n \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'Tampa Bay Rays.html'}]};
