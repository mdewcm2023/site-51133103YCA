Judge was unanimously selected as the American League (AL) Rookie of the Year in 2017, and finished second in voting for the AL Most Valuable Player Award that year. In 2022, he set the AL record for most home runs in a season with 62, breaking the 61-year-old record held by Roger Maris, and winning the AL Most Valuable Player Award. \n Judge played college baseball for the Fresno State Bulldogs, and the Yankees selected him with the 32nd pick in the first round of the 2013 MLB draft. After making his MLB debut in 2016 and hitting a home run in his first major league at bat, Judge went on to have a record-breaking rookie season. In 2017, he was named an All-Star, won the Home Run Derby (the first MLB rookie to do so), and hit 52 home runs, breaking Mark McGwire's MLB rookie record of 49 and Joe DiMaggio's Yankee full-season rookie record of 29. His rookie record stood for two years, until Pete Alonso hit 53 home runs in 2019. Judge won the AL Rookie of the Month Awards for April, May, June, and September, as well as the AL's Player of the Month Award for June and September. After the 2022 season, he re-signed with the Yankees on a nine-year, $360 million contract and was subsequently named the team's captain.\xa0 \n \n", 'tags': '', 'url': 'Star Player-1.html'}, {'title': 'Boston Red Sox', 'text': '\n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'Boston Red Sox.html'}, {'title': '2023 Roster-2', 'text': '\n \n \n Pitchers \n B/T \n Ht \n Wt \n DOB \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Richard Bleier \xa0 35 \n L/L \n 6\' 3" \n 215 \n 04/16/1987 \n \n \n \n \n \n Ryan Brasier \xa0 70 \n R/R \n 6\' 0" \n 227 \n 08/26/1987 \n \n \n \n \n \n Kutter Crawford \xa0 50 \n R/R \n 6\' 1" \n 209 \n 04/01/1996 \n \n \n \n \n \n Tanner Houck \xa0 89 \n R/R \n 6\' 5" \n 230 \n 06/29/1996 \n \n \n \n \n \n Kenley Jansen \xa0 74 \n S/R \n 6\' 5" \n 265 \n 09/30/1987 \n \n \n \n \n \n Zack Kelly \xa0 76 \n R/R \n 6\' 3" \n 205 \n 03/03/1995 \n \n \n \n \n \n Corey Kluber \xa0 28 \n R/R \n 6\' 4" \n 215 \n 04/10/1986 \n \n \n \n \n \n Chris Martin \xa0 55 \n R/R \n 6\' 8" \n 225 \n 06/02/1986 \n \n \n \n \n \n Kaleb Ort \xa0 61 \n R/R \n 6\' 4" \n 240 \n 02/05/1992 \n \n \n \n \n \n Nick Pivetta \xa0 37 \n R/R \n 6\' 5" \n 214 \n 02/14/1993 \n \n \n \n \n \n Chris Sale \xa0 41 \n L/L \n 6\' 6" \n 183 \n 03/30/1989 \n \n \n \n \n \n John Schreiber \xa0 46 \n R/R \n 6\' 2" \n 210 \n 03/05/1994 \n \n \n \n \n \n Josh Winckowski \xa0 25 \n R/R \n 6\' 4" \n 202 \n 06/28/1998 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Catchers \n B/T \n Ht \n Wt \n DOB \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Reese McGuire \xa0 3 \n L/R \n 6\' 0" \n 218 \n 03/02/1995 \n \n \n \n \n \n Connor Wong \xa0 12 \n R/R \n 6\' 1" \n 181 \n 05/19/1996 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Infielders \n B/T \n Ht \n Wt \n DOB \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Christian Arroyo \xa0 39 \n R/R \n 6\' 1" \n 210 \n 05/30/1995 \n \n \n \n \n \n Triston Casas \xa0 36 \n L/R \n 6\' 4" \n 252 \n 01/15/2000 \n \n \n \n \n \n Yu Chang \xa0 20 \n R/R \n 6\' 1" \n 180 \n 08/18/1995 \n \n \n \n \n \n Rafael Devers \xa0 11 \n L/R \n 6\' 0" \n 240 \n 10/24/1996 \n \n \n \n \n \n Enrique Hernández \xa0 5 \n R/R \n 5\' 11" \n 190 \n 08/24/1991 \n \n \n \n \n \n Justin Turner \xa0 2 \n R/R \n 5\' 11" \n 202 \n 11/23/1984 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Outfielders \n B/T \n Ht \n Wt \n DOB \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Adam Duvall \xa0 18 \n R/R \n 6\' 1" \n 215 \n 09/04/1988 \n \n \n \n \n \n Rob Refsnyder \xa0 30 \n R/R \n 6\' 0" \n 205 \n 03/26/1991 \n \n \n \n \n \n Raimel Tapia \xa0 17 \n L/L \n 6\' 3" \n 175 \n 02/04/1994 \n \n \n \n \n \n Alex Verdugo \xa0 99 \n L/L \n 6\' 0" \n 192 \n 05/15/1996 \n \n \n \n \n \n Masataka Yoshida \xa0 7 \n L/R \n 5\' 8" \n 176 \n 07/15/1993 \n \n \n \n', 'tags': '', 'url': '2023 Roster-2.html'}, {'title': 'Star Player-2', 'text': 'Yu-Chang \n \n Yu-Cheng Chang (Chinese: 張育成; pinyin: Zhāng Yùchéng;[a] born 18 August 1995) is a Taiwanese professional baseball infielder for the Boston Red Sox of Major League Baseball (MLB).

is a Japanese professional baseball pitcher, designated hitter and outfielder for the Los Angeles Angels of Major League Baseball (MLB). He previously played for the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters of Nippon Professional Baseball\'s (NPB) Pacific League. \n Considered early on as an elite two-way player, Ohtani was the first pick of the Fighters in the 2012 draft. He played in NPB for the Fighters from 2013 through 2017 as a pitcher and an outfielder, and won the 2016 Japan Series with them. The Fighters posted Ohtani to MLB after the 2017 season, and he signed with the Angels, soon winning the 2018 American League (AL) Rookie of the Year Award. \n Following an injury-plagued 2019 and 2020, Ohtani would go on to have a 2021 season widely considered to be historic, as he became the first in the history of MLB with 10+ home runs and 20+ stolen bases as a hitter and 100+ strikeouts and 10+ pitching appearances as a pitcher in the same season while also holding at least a share of the major league lead in home runs in fourteen starts.Because of his elite contributions both offensively and as a pitcher, a rarity for two-way players, Ohtani\'s peak is widely considered among the greatest in baseball history, with some comparing it favorably to the early career of Babe Ruth. For his efforts, he was awarded the 2021 American League Most Valuable Player Award. He followed this in 2022 by becoming the first player in the modern era to qualify for both the hitting and pitching leaderboards in one season, reaching the limits of 3.1 plate appearances and one inning pitched per game with 586 at bats against 166 innings pitched. \n Internationally, Ohtani also represented Japan in the 2023 World Baseball Classic, winning the MVP Award for the tournament following Team Japan\'s victory over Team USA. \n Mike Trout \n \n Michael Nelson Trout (born August 7, 1991) is an American professional baseball center fielder for the Los Angeles Angels of Major League Baseball (MLB). Trout is a ten-time MLB All-Star, three-time American League (AL) Most Valuable Player (MVP) (winning the award in 2014, 2016, and 2019, while finishing second in the 2012, 2013, 2015, and 2018 votes), and is a nine-time winner of the Silver Slugger Award. He also captained the United States national team during the 2023 World Baseball Classic. \n The Angels selected Trout in the first round of the 2009 MLB draft. He made a brief major league appearance in 2011 before becoming a regular player for the Angels the subsequent season, and won the 2012 AL Rookie of the Year Award unanimously. \n Trout\'s athleticism on the field has received praise from both the mainstream media and sabermetricians. He is regarded as one of the most outstanding young players in the history of baseball, as well as one of the best current players in all of MLB.Trout led the American League in wins above replacement (WAR) in each of his first five full seasons. \n Trout has led the American League in runs (2012–14, 2016) and times on base (2013, 2015–16, 2018) four times.]As of March 2023, he leads all active major league players in career slugging percentage (.587), on-base percentage (.415), on-base plus slugging (1.002), and is third in stolen base percentage (84.65%). In 2019, he signed a 12-year, $426 million contract with the Angels, the second-richest contract in the history of North American sports and fourth in professional sports in general (and the second-biggest contract at the time of signing). \n \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'Star Player-3.html'}, {'title': 'Oakland Athletics', 'text': '', 'tags': '', 'url': 'Oakland Athletics.html'}, {'title': '2023 Roster-13', 'text': '', 'tags': '', 'url': '2023 Roster-13.html'}, {'title': 'Seattle Mariners', 'text': '', 'tags': '', 'url': 'Seattle Mariners.html'}, {'title': '2023 Roster-14', 'text': '', 'tags': '', 'url': '2023 Roster-14.html'}, {'title': 'Texas Rangers', 'text': '', 'tags': '', 'url': 'Texas Rangers.html'}, {'title': '2023 Roster-15', 'text': '\n \n \n', 'tags': '', 'url': '2023 Roster-15.html'}]};
